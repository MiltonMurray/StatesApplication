/*******************************************************************************
 * Create a software package as a NetBeans project that contains three classes:
 *      > an executable class for the project itself 
 *      > a class of states, with the properties name, capital, and population
 *      > a class for an array of state objects
 * 
 * The state and array classes should contain appropriate properties and methods
 * to work with those properties. 
 * Your project’s class (with the same name as the package) should contain a main
 * method, and methods to test your other classes as follows:
 *      > load the data from the data file into the array of states. 
 *      > print the list of states -- including each state’s name, capital and
 *        population -- with the data for each state on a separate line. 
 *      > a method that asks the user for the name of a state, then either 
 *        displays the data for that state, or says the
 *        state was not found in the list.
 *
 * The main method should simply call the other methods in the class to show
 * that they work.
